# lab2-WordLadder-RandomWriter
A word ladder is a connection from one word to another formed by changing one letter at a time with the constraint that at each step the sequence of letters still forms a valid word. 
The random writer is designed to produce somewhat sensible output by generalizing from patterns found in the input text.
